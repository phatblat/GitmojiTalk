# Emoji Primer

# Brain Exercise üß†

- Executive Function
- Decision-making

^ Gitmoji is an extra talk to exercise your brain a bit differently

---

# Executive Function

an umbrella term for the neurologically-based skills involving mental control and self-regulation.

- Working memory
- Mental flexibility
- Self-control
- Self-monitoring
- Planning and problem solving

^ covers more than this list but these are what apply to this talk

---

# Working memory

governs our ability to retain and manipulate distinct pieces of information over short periods of time.

^ remembering what you just did and why

---

# Mental flexibility

helps us to sustain or shift attention in response to different demands or to apply different rules in different settings.

- writing code vs crafting commit message
- **abstraction!**

^ abstraction is key to communication and building bigger things, reusable code
^ those with autism have trouble with this

---

# Self-control

enables us to set priorities and resist impulsive actions or responses.

^ resisting the urge to make changes outside the scope of your current focus

---

# Self-monitoring

keeping track of what you‚Äôre doing

^ including your actions in memory

---

# Planning

thinking ahead of what type of changes you are going to a project

^ perhaps the commit messsage could help you decide what you're going to change

---

# Problem solving

process of investigating the given information and finding all possible solutions through invention or discovery

^ you are all probably good at problem solving

---

# Decision-making

actions taken to solve a problem

- choosing a name for a variable, method or type
- choosing an emoji to include in your commit message

^ don't get stuck in analysis paralysis
^ if it's hard, maybe the scope is too big

---

# TL;DR

it makes you think more about your commit messages and contents

---

# Gitmoji Best Practices

---

# One emoji per commit message

- Like a label
- Wanting to cram more emoji is a sign that your commit may not be focused
- üöë > üêõ

^ some emoji are similar but trump each other
^ ambulance is a type of bug

---

# Experiment, but be consistent within the project

- no need to use platform emoji on a single-platform project

---
